You should pay attention to relative path of files when use these tools in your program.

CalibrateFromPoints
Store calibrated parameters in a .yml for later use from a .ifl file which contains a list of image filenames.
This tool should be in the same directory with .ifl and images when it is used.

ChessboardCornerFinder
Find corners of chessboard and draw them in a new image.
Then the found coordinates are stored in a .yml file.
I strongly advise you to use this program in a bat file.

ChessboardImageGenerator
Generate images of chessboard for the convenience of making calibration image.

GetFingerPos
Find positions of fingertip in the two videos generated by VideoRecorder.
Here a simple strategy is used:
Assume the point with biggest y-value of hand region found is the fingertip.Have a look at the sample video,you will understand the rationality of this assumption.

ImageSampler
Sample images for calibration.


Show3dPoints
1>Reconstruct 3d coordinates of fingertip form 2d points which are stored files generated by GetFingerPos.
2>Show the reconstructed points in OpenGL with simple ability to change view.
3>draw reconstructed points on the image.

This Program should be in the same directory with files which store fingertip coordinates(*.avi.yml)

TestImageGenerate
This software is written for generate test images,however it does not really works.Just for fun for the moment.

VideoRecorder
Record video from two cameras synchronousely.
